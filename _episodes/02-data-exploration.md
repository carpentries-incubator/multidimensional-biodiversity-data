## Content
- Data types and types of analyses: case studies [Rob, Isaac]
- Load and explore (summary stats) a cleaned dataset [Isaac,  Jacob]
    - diversity indices...
- Worked analysis with cleaned data [Renata, Isaac]
    - Analyses could include a RoLE simulation among examples - avoiding too much technical detail
    - Could include multiple analyses to build in complexity
